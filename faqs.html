          <h3>How do I get an Alabama real estate license if I do not currently have one in any state?</h3></a>
        <p>To obtain a real estate license in the State of Alabama, all applicants must be 19 years of age with a high school diploma or G.E.D.</p>
        <p>Step 1 - Take a 60-hour pre-license course required by the Alabama Real Estate Commission. Offered on this web site via live instruction delivered to your computer  or self paced (Internet or CD-ROM). Successfully complete the course with the required 70% passing grade. You will receive a certificate of completion, which allows you to take the state exam.</p>
        <p>Step 2 - Take the state exam at one of four locations (Mobile, Montgomery, Birmingham, Athens or Huntsville). Test is given weekdays 8:00am - 5:00pm. Pass with a 70% grade or higher. You will receive the results the day of testing. </p>
        <p>Step 3 - You have 90 days from the date you passed the state exam to decide whether you want your license issued on an active or inactive status. </p>
        <p>You will choose active status if you are ready to actively practice real estate. In which case, you must select a broker to work with. The broker agrees to hold your license and be accountable with you for your actions as you practice real estate.</p>
        <p>You will choose inactive status if you do not want to actively practice real estate at this time. In which case, the Alabama Real Estate Commission will hold your license for you until you are ready to practice real estate. The real estate commission will hold your license for you indefinitely as long as you renew it on inactive status every two years as required by Alabama law.</p>

          <h3>How do I get an Alabama real estate license if I currently have a license in another state?</h3></a>
        <p>You can obtain an Alabama real estate license by reciprocity if you hold a current license (one that is not reciprocal) in another state. If you hold a salesperson's license in another state you can apply for a reciprocal Alabama salesperson's license. If you hold a broker's license in another state you can apply for a reciprocal Alabama broker's license. The application for a reciprocal license can be found at www.arec.alabama.gov.</p>

        <p>If your temporary license is active then you have six months from the date of issuance to complete post license to keep your license active. If you do not complete post license during this six-month period, your license will be placed on an inactive status and you have six more months to complete post license. If you do not complete post license during either of these six-month periods (twelve months total), then your temporary license will lapse and you will have to retake the prelicense course and retake the state exam.</p>
        <p>If your temporary license is inactive then you have twelve months from the date of issuance to complete post license. If you do not complete post license during this twelve-month period, your license will lapse and you will have to retake the course and retake the state exam.</p>
